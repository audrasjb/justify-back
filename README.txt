Oh noes, WP4.7 stole my justify text button ! Please bring it back (but keep underlining away, it sucks)

== Description ==

This plugin should be used to supply abbreviation support in the TinyMCE visual editor. Once activated, it provides an "ABR" button which allows editor to indicate the meaning of each abbreviation used in Pages, Posts or any custom post types used in your WordPress installation. The markup is fully compatible with accessibility rules like Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). It uses `<abbr>…</abbr>` HTML markup instead of the deprecated `<acronym>…</acronym>` HTML markup.
